    title: 'Bison Studio is',
    content: `
a design, code, and consulting studio that specializes in creating products that live on the web.
Bison Studio is owned and operated by [Devan Huapaya](http://imdevan.com).
And usually operates with partner freelancers and agencies. 
The end results are engaging products built on partnerships with the users in mind.<br/><br/>
Bison Studio specializes in building lean MVPs. That means we focus on the most important part of your users' experience and 
optimize around that. Everything else is fat that is cut out (of the first iteration) or whipped into shape.  <br/><br/>
We believe that web apps are the best apps. They work in the browser, which can already support your desktop and phone.
Modern technology is at a point where web apps can be built to be published to the app store and Google Play.

# FAQ

**How much do you charge?**

It depends, letâ€™s chat and we can work out a cost that works for both of us. <br/><br/>

**What if I canâ€™t afford your services?** 

Get in touch with us anyway and weâ€™ll work something out.
<br/><br/>

**Do you build web apps?**

Yes! Thatâ€™s our speciality. We work with React on the front end and are familiar with all things javascript.
<br/><br/>

**What's a web app?**

Web apps are apps that run on the web. Like Google docs, amazon, or your email, instead of this website you're currently viewing or a blog. 
<br/><br/>

**Isn't that just a website**

Kind of, there is definitely overlap. Web apps are basically websites with a lot of moving parts.
<br/><br/>

**Do you build websites?**

Yes! I made [this one](http://bisonstudio.co), [this one](http://designandcode.club), [this one](http://freelanceafternoon.com),

The one you're currently viewing was made with React.
<br/><br/>

Yes! We have experience creating apps that are built in browser technology that are published to the app store using
[cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).

It depends, usually not though.
